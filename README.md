Another project emmulating the google search result page.
 
I made use of most of the code I used in the Google Homepage project which I have in my repo. @ https://github.com/robtak/googgle-homepage

The Google Homepage project was to demonstrate my knowledge on the basic HTML and CSS which I have acquired since I started learning on on The-odin-project while Google Search Results Page is to further challenge me to develop my skills obtained.
